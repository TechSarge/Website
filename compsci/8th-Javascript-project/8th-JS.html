<!--Requirements:
1. Combine what you know about arrays and For Loops.
2. Define and itialize an array with at least 5 elements.
3. Calculate the average (or if not using numbers, build a story...something using the elements)
4. Push/add a new element to the array
5. Recalculate the average (or update the story, etc)
Note, when you input a new value it is stored as a string unless you use the parseInt command to turn it into a number...see the code example.
All best practices
