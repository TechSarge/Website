    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>hobbies</h2>
           <h3>Building rockets</h3>
                <p>I love building and launching rockets. I have a Jr. Level one certification so I can launch rockets with more fuel in them, even though I still am not old enough to touch the rocket fuel</p>
            <h3>Building computers</h3>
                <p>I love building computers even though I have only ever built one computer I also do some maintenance on my server and I love every second of it.
                when I built my gaming computer even though I do not game on it very often I love and I loved every second of it. Even the 3 days it took to install windows because windows does not like to work.
                My computer does tones of rendering, like videos, 3d models and audio. so having a nice computer is very nice to have for those things with them being very processing power intensive.</p>
            <h3>Sound engineering</h3>
                <p>I love sound engineering my job at this point in time is working at my church on the Audio/Visual team and I love it. Not only do I get to do sound engineering I get to yell at old computers that do not work
                very well at all but I Love it. The environment is the best and the people that I work with are the best. The sound board there is the only thing that I can rely on to work every sunday when I need it to work. But it is all in good fun.</p>
