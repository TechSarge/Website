    <h1>Pro Presenter</h1>
        <p>
        Welcome to where I will be posting things that I have to deal with and know about Pro Presenter and my work presentation setup. I am on the Audio/Video crew at my church and we are in the process
        of upgrading our video system with new macs, a new camera, and a new recording and streaming setup. I am very exited and also one of the lead people working out all of the technical stuff.
        This is where I will be adding some of the things that we are doing, not only for my future reference but hopefully help someone else as well.

        <h2>NDI</h2>
            <p>
                During the setup process we quickly figured out that we would want to keep the functionality that allows us to fade between the slides and the camera.
                I did not want to buy another capture card because I wanted to be able to do this for sunday and we could not get it here fast enough. So I decided to try
                this thing called a syphon output into a syphon to NDI converter.
